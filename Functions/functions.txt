************************************************************JavaScript Functions******************************************************************

- A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

- A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).



There are different ways to declare a funtion:-

a) Traditional Way: 
   In this a JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.

The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)

The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {} 

b) Arrow Funtion:
    In this JavaScript function, we have a anonymous(function without name) function which is assigned to a variable by which one can invoke 
    the function using variable name. 

c) Callback Function:
   - A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function

   - This technique allows a function to call another function

   - A callback function can run after another function has finished
