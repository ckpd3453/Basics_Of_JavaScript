- The map(), reduce() and filter() are array functions that transform the array according to the applied function and return the updated array. 
- They are used to write simple, short and clean codes for modifying an array instead of using the loops.

- map() method: It applies a given function on all the elements of the array and returns the updated array. 
  It is the simpler and shorter code instead of a loop.


- reduce() method: It reduces all the elements of the array to a single value by repeatedly applying a function. 
  It is an alternative of using a loop and updating the result for every scanned element.

- filter() method: It filters the elements of the array that return false for the applied condition and 
  returns the array which contains elements that satisfy the applied condition.
